# Introduction

It is common knowledge that education needs to adapt to the fast-changing world. In particular, when thinking about preparing the youth for the future, it is clear that the growing worldwide ICT usage and development raises new requirements for education and new opportunities in terms of effectiveness, quality, and scalability.

The education system is a complex system of complex systems with corresponding difficulties, namely when it comes to driving change.

Technology use in education promises to empower the educational system to serve the growth of its complexity while reducing the subjective complexity for all participants.

Over the past years, nothing has changed in edtech. However, everything has changed, which is true, especially if we look at the unprecedented events of 2020, which made the classic form of education impossible in a very short time for up to about 1.5 billion students at the peak (Unesco, 2020). The events have drawn attention to companies and startups developing relevant products and, due to their suddenness, initiated education disruption (Mascarenhas, 2020). 

This work aims to distil the most notable trends in the edtech industry and show them in the context of broader societal changes `?`.

Novelty and trends are by definition observed via change or difference in time. The general impact of technology on education will be derived from the digital revolution's and the digital transformation's implications. Digital transformation drives the economy towards industry 4.0, which builds heavily on using technology to mass production and making informed decisions in the world of big data. Another challenge that digital transformation imposes is the information revolution describing the technology as being closer to humans. Its position transforms from being a mere tool to becoming an equal partner. The pursuit of alignment of technology and society or harmony between technology and society is described by Society 5.0.

# What is EdTech

The definition of education builds on the core which is "learning" however it does not include only the facilitation of persons learning. Instead, we must acknowledge the social aspects of education as an organization, educational institutions and a wider social context that takes place in one's learning. "As a whole, then, the term ‘education’ can be best understood as the conditions and arrangements where learning takes place." (Selwyn, 2017)

As Albert Teich succinctly puts it, ‘technology is more than just machines (1997, p. 1).

"In particular our primary focus should not be on the actual technological devices, tools and applications per se, but the practices and activities that surround them, the meanings that people attach to them, and the social relations and structures that these technologies are linked to." [^education]

> educational technologies do not always change things for the better. Technologies do not always allow people to work more efficiently, or support people in doing what they want. Instead, educational technologies can often have unexpected and unintended consequences.

Lievrouw and Livingstone include and conceptualize the social aspects in the definition of technology:
- artefacts and devices: that is, the technology itself and how it is designed and made;
- activities and practices: that is, what people do with technologies (including issues of human interaction, organizing, identity, cultural practices);
- context: that is, social arrangements and organizational forms that surround the use of technologies (including institutions, social structures and cultures).

# Context

## Digitalization

The term digitalization have a variety of meanings. The technical interpretation of the term refers to conversion of information from the analog to the digital storage. (Hess, 2019; Hess et al., 2016) Today its often used for introduction of digital technologies in companies. (Pousttchi, 2017)

The exponential growth of technology is perhaps the most discussed characteristic of digital transformation. The growth itself is shown in various metrics, while the most popular is observation of growing number of transistors on microchips described by the Moore's law. 

One of the main characteristics of digital transformation and industrial revolution 4.0. is observed exponential growth and associated compounding effect.

The term digitalization have a variety of meanings. The technical interpretation of the term refers to conversion of information from the analog to the digital storage. (Hess, 2019; Hess et al., 2016) Today its often used for introduction of digital technologies in companies.

## Exponential nature of technology 

## Digital transformation

"Research has shown that technology itself is only part of the complex puzzle that must be solved for organizations to remain competitive in a digital world" (Vial, 2019) Since digitalization leads to change of a business conditions, digitalization is usually the main driver of digital transformation. (Pousttchi, 2017)

“There is no comonly accepted definition of digital transformation”. (Schallmo et al., 2017) A concievable description of the term may be "significant active changes in everyday life, the economy and society through the use of digital technologies and techniques and their effects." (Pousttchi, 2017) Based on existing definitions, Vial (2019) developed a conceptual definition of digital transformation as “a process that aims to improve an entity by triggering significant changes to its properties through combinations of information, computing, communication, and connectivity technologies”. 

The term digitalization is known to be sometimes used with the meaning of digital transformation. (Hess et al., 2016) It is important to note the indirectly mentioned fact from the work of Pousttchi (2017), that increase of digital technology usage or digitalization alone, do not imply the presence of digital transformation in its full range and potential.

The pursue towards understanding DT and its implications is reflected in management, leadership and business. () The topic of digital transformation and more precisely the question of "how to embrace it and use it as a competitive advantage" is considered as one of the biggest challenges companies currently face. (Hess et al., 2016)

In the organizational setting the DT is "reflected in the change of entire business models brought about by digital technologies". (Hess et al., 2016) 

As Vial's (2019) conceptual definition reffers DT to any entity, the process of DT applies to organizations and companies as well as individuals. 


## Industrial revolution 4.0

"Technology dominates and defines civilisation. Our commonest taxonomy of civilisation is a recognition of the role different technologies play in human life: the Stone Age, Bronze Age and Iron Age of archaeologists; the industrialised Steam, Oil, and now Silicon Age" (Bondyopadhyay, 1998).

"The invention of the digital electronic computer and the consequent invention of the computer network is arguably the technology with the second greatest impact on learning after writing itself."

Among the drivers of education  Digital transformation "a process that aims to improve an entity by triggering significant changes to its properties through combinations of information, computing, communication, and connectivity technologies" (Vial, 2019). Among those changes

One of the main characteristics of digital transformation and industrial revolution 4.0. is observed exponencial growth and associated compounding effect.

# Innovation and startups 

In his essay, Paul Graham defines startup as "a company that is designed to grow rapidly." "A startup has to make something it can deliver to a large market, and ideas of that type are so valuable that all the obvious ones are already taken." Most startups fail.

- [[how does a startup relate to a broader economy]]
	- debate on startups and innovation: it is not clear wheter startup ecosystem is driver of innovation or vice versa. I guess it depends on philosophical view.

- funding ecosystem
- VCs and market efficiency - does investment reflect potential value?

# EdTech classification

Classification in edtech is hard, holoniq offers holistic classification of edtech in a broadest sense which is consistent with the purpose of this thesis.


# Methodology

## Data source

In order to show the most notable trends within the EdTech industry, the author decided to look at startups operating in the industry. As described in theory startups being designed to grow rapidly, should aim to solve the biggest, hardest and most recurring problems.

The author assumes that investing rounds of startups and raised capital may reflect the most notable trends in EdTech. This assumption is anchored in the theory of startup market efficiency described in the first part of the work. 

Another assumption being made is that education systems are havily dependent on the region. 


The main objective of the research is thus to identify the trends among the leading companies as grouped by continents.

Finding information about private companies is challenging. The author decided to leverage the database of innovative companies "maintained by Crunchbase Inc. a company founded in 2007 by Michael Arrington and located in San Francisco, California". The company, now being an independent entity is a former branch of a parent company TechCrunch Inc. "a popular online publication". (Ferrati & Muffatto, 2020)

The database is increasingly used by the venture capital industry. Between researchers and scholars, the database is increasingly popular "as a source of information on start-up activity and financing within and across countries", "more than 90 scientific contributions based on its data have been made available so far." Some of the academic articles are already published in top-tier journals. (Using Crunchbase for Economic and Managerial Research, 2017)

The Crunchbase data is mainly entered on a voluntary basis, the scope and coverage of the database are not precisely defined. (Ferrati & Muffatto, 2020; Using Crunchbase for Economic and Managerial Research, 2017) Crunchbase data collection consists of 4 activities: 1) "more than 3,700 investment firms submit monthly portfolio updates", 2) active community of executives, entrepreneurs, and investors contributing, 3) Crunchbase AI and ML algorithms validate data and search for anomalies, 4) Crunchbase in-house data science team provide manual data validation and curation of collected data and develops algorithms. (‘The Crunchbase Data Difference’, 2017; Ferrati & Muffatto, 2020)

 The "aggregate statistics on VC funding by country and year tend to be reasonably similar to the same figures produced with an alternative and more established source". Compared to other alternatives, the Crunchbase database "does not require a huge amount of data handling before it can be used for econometric analysis". (Using Crunchbase for Economic and Managerial Research, 2017)

As of May 21, 2019, the Crunchbase corpus contained a total of 760,590 records in the Organisation’s dataset and 263,426 records in the Funding rounds dataset. Of the total number of companies approximately 79.9% do not declare any funding round, 5.5% have at least one funding round without funding amount specified and 14.6% have at least one funding round and are declaring the total funding amount. (Ferrati & Muffatto, 2020) The platform allows users to filter companies and funding rounds by industries. A brief database query was resolved with ~ 4,377 funding rounds for companies classified in the EdTech industry, while 3,261 of them have defined funding amount.  

The dataset of funding rounds for further analysis was obtained using an export feature from the database which returns a .csv file corresponding to a selected query. Since the platform proclaims an export limit of 500 items per request, the author obtained the dataset in chucks to prevent hitting the limit and then constructed the dataset by concatenating the .csv files.

## Data processing

The data processing was done using Python3 and popular data science SciPy libraries namely:
- NumPy: "the fundamental package for numerical computation. It defines the numerical array and matrix types and basic operations on them."
- Pandas: "providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures.",
- Matplotlib: "a mature and popular plotting package that provides publication-quality 2-D plotting, as well as rudimentary 3-D plotting."

I've did some basic preprocessing like automatically trying to request the company URL and check if the website returns status 200. That eliminated dozens of companies from the list.

I've tried to investigate the possibility of automatic company classification using some simple unsupervised techniques (keyword extraction from company description) but it turns out it doesnt really pay off even as an help for classification by hand.

Raised capital amounts we converted to current value `for which date?` and US dollars in order to be comparable.
