# Introduction

It is common knowledge that education needs to adapt to the fast-changing world we live in. In particular, when thinking about preparing the youth for the future it is clear that the growing worldwide ICT usage and development raises new requirements for education, as well as new opportunities in term of effectiveness, quality and scalability.

The education system is a complex system of complex systems with corresponding difficulties namely when it comes to driving change.

Technology use in education promises to empower the educational system to serve the growth of its complexity while reducing the subjective complexity for all participants.

Over the past years nothing has changed in edtech yet everything has changed, which is true especially if we look at the unprecedented events of 2020 which made the classic form of education impossible in a very short period of time for up to about 1.5 billion students at the peak (Unesco, 2020). The events have drawn attention to companies and startups developing relevant products and due to their suddenness initiated the disruption of education (Mascarenhas, 2020). 

This work aims to distil the most notable trends in the edtech industry and show them in the context of wider societal changes `?`.

## What is EdTech

The definition of education builds on the core which is "learning" however it does not include only the facilitation of persons learning. Instead, we must acknowledge the social aspects of education as an organization, educational institutions and a wider social context that takes place in one's learning. "As a whole, then, the term ‘education’ can be best understood as the conditions and arrangements where learning takes place." (Selwyn, 2017)

As Albert Teich succinctly puts it, ‘technology is more than just machines (1997, p. 1).

"In particular our primary focus should not be on the actual technological devices, tools and applications per se, but the practices and activities that surround them, the meanings that people attach to them, and the social relations and structures that these technologies are linked to." [^education]

> educational technologies do not always change things for the better. Technologies do not always allow people to work more efficiently, or support people in doing what they want. Instead, educational technologies can often have unexpected and unintended consequences.

Lievrouw and Livingstone include and conceptualize the social aspects in the definition of technology:
- artefacts and devices: that is, the technology itself and how it is designed and made;
- activities and practices: that is, what people do with technologies (including issues of human interaction, organizing, identity, cultural practices);
- context: that is, social arrangements and organizational forms that surround the use of technologies (including institutions, social structures and cultures).

## Revisiting the purpose of education

`educated free citizen X economic perspective`

### Digital transformation driving change in education

Novelty and trends are by definition observed via change or difference in time. The general impact of technology on education will be derived from the digital revolution's and the digital transformation's implications. Digital transformation drives the economy towards industry 4.0, which builds heavily on using technology to mass production and making informed decisions in the world of big data. Another challenge that digital transformation imposes is the information revolution describing the technology as being closer to humans. Its position transforms from being a mere tool to becoming an equal partner. The pursuit of alignment of technology and society or harmony between technology and society is described by Society 5.0.

To note the impact of technology in education, we need to understand these phenomena in slightly greater detail, we first need to understand the characteristics of technology on human civilization throughout history and what we mean by the digital revolution. 

#### Historical perspective

"Technology dominates and defines civilisation. Our commonest taxonomy of civilisation is a recognition of the role different technologies play in human life: the Stone Age, Bronze Age and Iron Age of archaeologists; the industrialised Steam, Oil, and now Silicon Age" (Bondyopadhyay, 1998).

"The invention of the digital electronic computer and the consequent invention of the computer network is arguably the technology with the second greatest impact on learning after writing itself."

Among the drivers of education  Digital transformation "a process that aims to improve an entity by triggering significant changes to its properties through combinations of information, computing, communication, and connectivity technologies" (Vial, 2019). Among those changes  

`co charakterzuje industry 4.0.`

One of the main characteristics of digital transformation and industrial revolution 4.0. is observed exponencial growth and associated compounding effect.

#### Implications of digital transformation for education

A shorter skill/information lifespan
Updating core skills
	learning and initiative towards lifelong learning
	competencies to deal with complex problems
	critical thinking
	wisdom/common sense
	abillity to think globally
	ICT
Restructuring educational system
Opening to informal learning
Supporting teaching and learning
Digital devide
Marginalized nations and groups

## Innovation and startups in EdTech

In his essay, Paul Graham defines startup as "a company that is designed to grow rapidly." "A startup has to make something it can deliver to a large market, and ideas of that type are so valuable that all the obvious ones are already taken." Most startups fail.

##  Mapping edtech startups

In order to show the most notable trends within the EdTech industry, the author decided to look at startups operating in the industry. As described in theory startups being designed to grow rapidly, should aim to solve the biggest, hardest and most recurring problems.

The author assumes that investing rounds of startups and raised capital may reflect the most notable trends in EdTech. This assumption is anchored in the theory of startup market efficiency described in the first part of the work. 

Another assumption being made is that education systems are havily dependent on the region. 

### Objectives

The main objective of the research is thus to identify the trends among the leading companies as grouped by continents.

### Methodology

#### Data source

I obtained a dataset of funding rounds using export feature from Crunchbase which is a platform for finding business information about private and public companies. The platform originated from Techcrunch and is now a private entity. There is a discussion on using Crunchbase in academic research. 

There are ~ 4,377 funding rounds for companies classified in the edtech industry while 3,261 of them have defined funding amount.

`The problem of classification in the CB`

#### Data processing

The data processing was done using Python3 and popular data science SciPy libraries namely:
- NumPy: "the fundamental package for numerical computation. It defines the numerical array and matrix types and basic operations on them."
- Pandas: "providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures.",
- Matplotlib: "a mature and popular plotting package that provides publication-quality 2-D plotting, as well as rudimentary 3-D plotting."

I've did some basic preprocessing like automatically trying to request the company URL and check if the website returns status 200. That eliminated dozens of companies from the list.

I've tried to investigate the possibility of automatic company classification using some simple unsupervised techniques (keyword extraction from company description) but it turns out it doesnt really pay off even as an help for classification by hand.

Raised capital amounts we converted to current value `for which date?` and US dollars in order to be comparable.
