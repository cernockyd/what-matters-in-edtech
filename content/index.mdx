# Introduction

Society faces unprecedented challenges. With the growing worldwide ICT usage and development, new requirements for education need to be considered. It can be seen as the events of 2020 made the classic form of education impossible in a very short time for up to about 1.5 billion students at the peak (Unesco, 2020). The Covid-19 pandemic has due to its suddenness, initiated education disruption drawing attention to companies and startups developing relevant products (Mascarenhas, 2020b).

Both market and the academic world share the pursuit of prediction of the future. This thesis goal is to present the most important global trends in EdTech and grasp the topic in the most concise way while keeping a reasonable degree of rigour. We hold a narrow perspective on what matters in EdTech and aim to identify trends within the domain by analysing EdTech companies that received the biggest funding sum in non IPO raisings. The analysis is done by identification of HolonIQ&#39;s (2021b) clusters from the taxonomy for the future of education within the selected companies. The clusters identification was done during an auxiliary analysis of each company in terms of the problems they claim to be solving, their target groups, solutions, and remarks. Results are presented as EdTech clusters frequency analysis. Results are discussed and compared with trends identified by industry experts.

# What is EdTech

Educational technology (commonly abbreviated as EdTech) is an established term both in the general audience and within the education profession. However, at the same time, the term is very vague as defining EdTech is notoriously difficult. &quot;Various professional and scholarly communities have provided a specific definition of the term&quot; (Huang et al., 2019, p. 8). However, the definition is not straightforward and there is no clear definition of the term (&#39;Reflections on the 2008 AECT Definitions of the Field&#39;, 2008). Instead, similarly to other areas, &quot;definition exists at various levels of understanding but no one definition can be the definition&quot; (Ely, Donald P, 1963, chapter 3). The definitions vary depending on the views we take. Moreover, as the technological and educational practice evolves, the community reflects shortcomings of existing definitions and come up with new ones (&#39;Reflections on the 2008 AECT Definitions of the Field&#39;, 2008).

EdTech may be possibly defined as a domain that encompasses emerging technologies; the impact of technologies on learning and education; and related issues, challenges and promises of using technology in educational settings, and a scholarly discipline or a professional field (Czerniewicz, 2008; Sims &amp; Stone, 2011).

Drawing boundaries between mentioned conceptions of EdTech isn&#39;t easy, since they are all interconnected and eventually intertwine. It appears to us that the most common element of all EdTech conceptions is the shared purpose of examining and solving problems in education. All the conceptions then lay on the assumption that such a particular effort is meaningful. Thus the effort is made while keeping in mind it should lead to better results than if solving educational problems without the effort, knowledge and deep understanding of the domain.

## EdTech products

EdTech is usually &quot;understood as the utilisation of apps and tech devices for the purpose of teaching and learning. EdTech can happen inside or outside of classrooms, at any time and in any place. Most modern EdTech typically involves the use of a wireless internet connection and an electronic device such as a smartphone, tablet, laptop or desktop computer&quot; (European Commission. Joint Research Centre., 2021).

For the purpose of this thesis, we primarily view EdTech as products, which share a common purpose of solving problems related to education, teaching and learning. &quot;Technology is one of the keywords of our world, yet it is also one of the most confused&quot; (Agar, 2020). Perhaps the most common usage of the term denotes to artifacts or perhaps hardware. The term is being used also to represent processes, actions, methods and systems and in a symbolical meaning as an attribute with the notion of evaluation (Kline, 1985). Thus, the term &#39;EdTech products&#39; encompass hard technology as well as soft technologies. Since EdTech products are preferably a product of examined pursue, we will later introduce EdTech as a scholarly discipline and professional practice.

## EdTech topics overview timeline

According to Weller, (2018), an evident theme in the field is that there appear to be no shared concepts or history. He attributes it to the fact that many people from various backgrounds and disciplines enter the field and circumstances in the field are changing. The following timeline builds heavily on Bozkurt&#39;s (2020) study on research patterns of the field and Weller&#39;s, (2018, 2020) reflection on the history of the field, giving us an instant, simplifying and opinionated overview of EdTech development reaching the current state of the art.

## Understanding EdTech

Our views and assumptions on education and technology, or perhaps EdTech, shape our understanding of EdTech and its potential or pitfalls. &quot;It was observed that innovation is a magical word and there is a tendency to refer to innovative, exciting technologies as the next big thing that will save education&quot; (Bozkurt, 2020). We hold the opinion that such a perception is indeed misleading. &quot;The history of new and emerging educational technologies suggests that promises of significant and sustained improvements on a large scale that will dramatically transform learning are unlikely to occur as promised&quot; (Spector, 2016, p. 213). However, noting that nothing has changed in education over the last years, appears too to be misleading since the changes coming with are radically new in different ways and nuances which are perhaps harder to perceive, eg. see Downes (2020). A following brief examination of EdTech as a scholarly discipline and a professional field through the lens of AECT provides us with clues to understand EdTech in a more detailed way.

### EdTech as study and ethical practice

According to Richey (2013, pp. 102–104), the origin of educational technology can be tracked down into the 1920s concept of visual education, followed by the 1940s audio-visual education. The development of the concept of EdTech starting from the visual education is to a large extent captured in the work of The Association for Educational Communications and Technology (AECT), which began as &quot;US-based Department of Visual Instruction in 1923, and became 50 years later, in 1973, an international organization of educational technologists&quot;. The AECT &quot;has maintained definitions and terminology committee through the decades that reflects the conceptual issues around educational technology&quot;. Even though the scholarly community hardly agrees on a concrete definition of EdTech, the definitions provide us with a guidance and direction (Hlynka &amp; Jacobsen, 2010).

According to the most recent, 2008 AECT definition, &quot;educational technology is the study and ethical practice of facilitating learning and improving performance by creating, using and managing appropriate technological processes and resources&quot; (Januszewski &amp; Molenda, 2013, p. 1; &#39;Reflections on the 2008 AECT Definitions of the Field&#39;, 2008).

By referring to EdTech as a study and ethical practice, the latest definition emphasizes the continual, iterative knowledge construction through research and reflective practice beyond traditional research methods and sets the field ethical standards for practice. Historically, the question of how to design, develop, use, and manage new technologies, has been centre of the interest. However more recently &quot;the growth and change in major theoretical positions in learning theory, information management, and other allied fields&quot;, has affected the fields concerns. The implications of the paradigm shift in learning theories may be seen in the recognition of learner ownership and responsibility leading to 1) supporting learning via facilitation rather than controlling, and 2) providing more immersive and authentic learning environments. The key role of technology then &quot;is not so much to present information and provide drill and practice (to control learning) but to provide the problem space and the tools to explore it (to support learning)&quot; (Januszewski &amp; Molenda, 2013, pp. 1–2).

The emphasis on the ethical side in the definition admits the possible problems in practice; that is, it must be considered that educational technology outputs and practices do not always make things better by their very nature. &quot;Educational technology entails a number of professional, ethical, and moral values&quot; although it is not stated in the short excerpt version of the definition (Januszewski &amp; Molenda, 2013, p. 241).

For example, &quot;one of the implicit goals of educational technology is to improve access to learning through ICT&quot; (Januszewski &amp; Molenda, 2013, p. 255). The term performance improvement in the definition &quot;entails a claim of effectiveness: that the processes lead predictably to quality products, and that the products lead predictably to effective learning&quot;. &quot;Effectiveness implies efficiency, that is, that results are accomplished with the least wasted time, effort, and expense&quot;. The values of effectiveness and efficiency apply to all elements of the definition, &quot;especially to improving the performance of individual learners, of teachers and designers, and the organization as a whole&quot; (Januszewski &amp; Molenda, 2013, pp. 6–7, 255). Note that even values of efficiency and effectiveness depend based on the learning theories and value-related goals.&quot; (Januszewski &amp; Molenda, 2013, p. 255).

# EdTech drivers

## Ongoing digitalisation and digital transformation

Although the term digitalization has a variety of meanings. The technical interpretation of the term refers to the conversion of information from analog to digital storage (Hess, 2019; Hess et al., 2016). The term digitalization is often used for the introduction of digital technologies in companies.. Since digitalization leads to change of business conditions, it is usually the main driver of digital transformation (Pousttchi, 2020).

There is no doubt that digitalization leads to bigger effectivity in many areas, but it is increasingly necessary not to focus merely on the advances in terms of technological progress (Mergel et al., 2019; Vial, 2019). &quot;Technology is one part of the complex system to be solved for organizations to remain competitive in a digital world&quot; (Vial, 2019). The question of &quot;how to embrace it and use it as a competitive advantage&quot; is considered one of the biggest challenges companies currently face (Hess et al., 2016).

&quot;There is no commonly accepted definition of digital transformation&quot; (Schallmo et al., 2017). A conceivable description of digital transformation may be &quot;significant active changes in everyday life, the economy and society through the use of digital technologies and techniques and their effects&quot; (Pousttchi, 2020). Based on existing definitions, Vial, (2019) developed a more general conceptual definition of digital transformation as &quot;a process that aims to improve an entity by triggering significant changes to its properties through combinations of information, computing, communication, and connectivity technologies&quot;. Perhaps the most discussed characteristic of digital transformation and industrial revolution 4.0. is the exponential growth of technology. The growth itself is shown in various metrics, while the most popular is an observation of the growing number of transistors on microchips described by Moore&#39;s law.

As Vial&#39;s (2019) conceptual definition refers DT to any entity, the process of DT applies to organizations and companies as well as individuals. In companies, DT implies the need to embrace complexity with a new mindset. Setting the DT is &quot;reflected in the change of entire business models brought about by digital technologies&quot; (Hess et al., 2016).

According to Cairneagle Associates &amp; IBIS Capital (2020), &quot;the science of learning is moving EdTech beyond simple digitalisation towards digital transformation&quot;. The need to adapt to the technology-driven world is by no means relevant to learning and education too. In education, the digital transformation manifests in changes that naturally differ based on context and sphere. In the operation of whole educational organizations, technology does not only power standard processes thus make them more efficient eg. in term of speed. However, brings new perspectives on running an organization and navigating change and opens opportunity for completely new processes. The teaching and learning practices are not affected only in terms of classroom &amp; learning technology usage growth. As the unprecedented reality sets new standards for desired educational outcomes of students, the whole curriculum changes, opening new requirements for teaching and facilitation too.

## Covid-19 recovery

The case of the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic event is referred to as an example of disruption as many people and organisations including education organisations, adopted to using technology in a short period since they had no other option. Note the classic form of education was impossible for up to about 1.5 billion students at the peak (Unesco, 2020). Sudden adoption and acceleration, however, did not necessarily bring about a fundamental transformation of existing practices in many cases. It is important to note the indirectly mentioned fact from the work of Pousttchi, (2020), that increase in digital technology usage or digitalisation alone, does not imply the presence of digital transformation in its full range and potential.

In general, the Covid-19 has accelerated ongoing emerging trends in education, of which some are not expected to revert and rather are expected to consolidate. We list the following trends regard to EdTech by drawing on the Educause Horizon 2021 report
and the Global EdTech Report 2020.

Remote work and learning:remote modes of education are expected to stay to some degree. The faculty and staff need to discover best practices to adapt to student&#39;s needs, while students as well need to develop literacies and skills for remote education (EDUCAUSE, 2021).

Increased use of learning technologies: &quot;institutions and instructors previously resistant or indifferent to tools such as videoconferencing, team-based platforms, and virtual classrooms have come to rely on those tools&quot; (EDUCAUSE, 2021). The trend is expected to continue with other innovative technologies and &quot;digital tools that create better engagement and efficacy&quot; (Cairneagle Associates &amp; IBIS Capital, 2020).

Rise of hybrid learning models:faculty and student accustoming to new ways of engaging through the learning experience will likely leave mark on higher education and transform traditional teaching and learning approaches. (Cairneagle Associates &amp; IBIS Capital, 2020; EDUCAUSE, 2021)

Mental health issues:&quot;recent disruptions and changes to our social, political, and educational landscapes and have presented institutions with additional challenges in ensuring the safety and well-being of not only students but also faculty and staff&quot; (EDUCAUSE, 2021).

Demand for new skills: ongoing technological progress and accelerated adoption, as well as rapid skills, demand change pose new requirements on skills and literacies. Government funding is expected to be limited, leading to restrictions in &quot;institutional demand to address digital resources and upskilling&quot; (Cairneagle Associates &amp; IBIS Capital, 2020).

Limited government funding: the economic landscape influenced by the recession is expected to focus on ROI and absolute cost. Likewise, &quot;supply-side stress from COVID-19 and subsequent recession will drive increased consolidation based around established players and those with deep-pocketed shareholders&quot; (Cairneagle Associates &amp; IBIS Capital, 2020).

Widening the digital divide: &quot;the gap will only widen between those with every digital advantage and those who struggle to gain access to even the basic devices and network necessities&quot; (EDUCAUSE, 2021).

Network effects and exponential growth: for companies and institutions, the valuation will create a divide between those who show traction and scalability and those who struggle to adapt and cope with the new environment. At the same tim &quot;geographical variances in infrastructure will impact regional acceleration capability&quot;. Asian and the United States markets are expected to continue lead due to their early EdTech investments position (Cairneagle Associates &amp; IBIS Capital, 2020).

## Key technologies and practices

The latest EDUCAUSE Horizon Report maps &quot;the landscape of emerging technologies that have the potential to have a significant influence on teaching, learning and creative inquiry&quot; (Spector, 2016). Further drawing on the latest Horizon Report and Global EdTech Report 2020, we list the following key technologies and practices, while trying to briefly describe them to outline their potential for all levels of education.

Artificial intelligence: AI is currently used throughout education &quot;in domains such as learning management systems, proctoring, grading/assessment, student information systems, office productivity, library services, admissions, disability support, and mobile apps&quot; (EDUCAUSE, 2021). AI and especially its deep learning subfield is expected to improve the educational efficacy of both humans and machines. Such improvements make an opportunity to rethink the curriculums (Cairneagle Associates &amp; IBIS Capital, 2020).

Blended and Hybrid Course Models:the already mentioned trend of growth in hybrid learning models motivated by greater flexibility due to pandemic is expected to stay. Faculties providing a diverse sets of hybrid course models to meet the students may invite students to participate in curriculum and course design. Course models also generate management overhead and may depend on EdTech solutions (EDUCAUSE, 2021). Private education is also expected to &quot;see a surge in new online or hybrid educational solutions&quot; (Cairneagle Associates &amp; IBIS Capital, 2020).

Learning Analytics: The growing amount of data related to teaching and learning often sourced &quot;in the learning management system, student information system, and cocurricular data sources&quot; open new possibilities regard to data analysis. &quot;One goal is to make better, evidence-informed decisions about how best to serve an increasingly diverse population of learners in higher education settings&quot;. Data are often heavily dependend on departments and courses making it harder to mine the important signals effectively. Institutions are expected to evolve systems to manage and utilize the data (EDUCAUSE, 2021).

Microcredentialing: A variety of microcredentialing options include short courses and badges, bootcamps, professional certificates and licenses, non-university-issued nondegree certificates, university-issued nondegree certificates, and degree programs or accredited programs (HolonIQ, 2021c). In contrast to traditional degrees and certificates, microcredentials are offered in shorter or more flexible timespans and tend to be more narrowly (EDUCAUSE, 2021).

Open Educational Resources: free resources accessible digitally from anywhere on any device grow in importance. The OER&#39;s may include increasingly complex and innovative types of resources. &quot;Moving well beyond textbooks, many projects and resources submitted to this year&#39;s report now include cutting-edge, openly accessible content such as Virtual Immersive Teaching and Learning&quot; (Ibid).

Quality Online Learning: Strategies &quot;for how to effectively teach online and how to design quality courses&quot; and address pain points of teaching and facilitation in a new environment. Online education often promotes stress among the faculty, staff and students as it brings significant overhead in finding new strategies to function effectively. &quot;Colleges and universities brought to bear a variety of strategies, including templates, self-directed courses, consultation, resource hubs, and more&quot; (Ibid).

# Innovation ecosystems and startups funding

Productivity growth is driven by innovation and human capital leading to increased output and consumption per capita and enhanced economic well-being. (Frenkel &amp; Maital, 2014, p. 3). &quot;Increasingly, researchers and policymakers alike recognize that innovations are generated by complex and dynamic national ecosystems that include government, industry, universities and schools&quot; (Ibid, abstract). Thus the innovation ecosystems differ by country and are heavily dependent on culture, scientific and technological infrastructure, the structure of the economy, markets and regulations (Ibid, p. 122).

Innovative businesses and startups are mainly part of the market dimension of the innovation ecosystems seeking to satisfy unmet needs and wants in a profitable and sustainable way. Given the national innovation policy, businesses are more or less part of national innovation strategy complementing the innovation strategy with the bottom-up innovation perspective and drive, although businesses may also fulfil the bottom-up academic alike approach (Ibid, pp. 23, 199–200).

## What is a startup?

We use the word businesses, companies and startups interchangeably for the purpose of this thesis. However, to understand the main difference between regular businesses and startups, a distinction can be noted. In his essay, Graham (2012) defines a startup as &quot;a company that is designed to grow rapidly.&quot;In general, normal businesses are constrained in coming up with new ideas and protected from competition. Whereas a startup has to make something it can deliver to a large market to grow rapidly, &quot;and ideas of that type are so valuable that all the obvious ones are already taken.&quot; Funding startups and emerging companies are known as the venture capital industry. Most startups fail, therefore for early-stage investors, startups pose a high risk, high stake, and eventually high returns opportunity if a startup succeeds.

## Startup funding

Companies may receive funding from individuals and private or public institutions typically arranged in funding rounds. Funding rounds are distinguished according to the types of investors, sizes of investment amount and stage of the companies development. There are different types of funding rounds and each investment may be arranged differently making it harder to describe the funding. We will note the most important ones for simplicity.

Investments from individuals are typically arranged in angel funding rounds or Pre-Seed rounds. Investments in an angel round are in general more geographically concentrated and include individual angel investors, friends, and family (Cruchbase, 2020; Moon &amp; Suh, 2021, abstract). A pre-seed round is a small pre-institutional investment often below $150k.

The company receives seed round while working to gain traction, with investments usually between $10k–$2M. Funding from Venture Capital institutions is typically more industry concentrated with &quot;relatively greater geographic diversification&quot; (Moon &amp; Suh, 2021, abstract). Venture capital early-stage investments are known as Series A, Series B ranging from $1M–$30M on average. Investors may strategically overinvest during the early-stage funding rounds to gain long-run difference in firm growth over competitors (Inderst &amp; Mueller, 2009).

Series C rounds with usually $10M+ and later rounds are &quot;for later stage and more established companies&quot;. Other late-stage rounds are usually led by private equity firms or hedge funds as these investments are less risky &quot;because the company is more firmly established, and the rounds are typically upwards of $50M&quot; (Cruchbase, 2020).

# Companies funding data source

Finding information about companies, and especially private ones is challenging. We decided to leverage the database of innovative companies &quot;maintained by Crunchbase Inc. a company founded in 2007 by Michael Arrington and located in San Francisco, California&quot;. The company, now being an independent entity is a former branch of a parent company TechCrunch Inc. &quot;a popular online publication&quot; (Ferrati &amp; Muffatto, 2020).

The database is increasingly used by the venture capital industry. Between researchers and scholars, the database is increasingly popular &quot;as a source of information on start-up activity and financing within and across countries&quot;. &quot;More than 90 scientific contributions based on its data have been made available so far&quot;. Some of the academic articles are already published in top-tier journals (_Using Crunchbase for Economic and Managerial Research_, 2017).

The Crunchbase data is mainly centred on a voluntary basis. The scope and coverage of the database are not precisely defined (Ferrati &amp; Muffatto, 2020; _Using Crunchbase for Economic and Managerial Research_, 2017). Crunchbase data collection consists of 4 activities: 1) &quot;more than 3,700 investment firms submit monthly portfolio updates&quot;, 2) active community of executives, entrepreneurs, and investors contributing, 3) Crunchbase AI and ML algorithms validate data and search for anomalies, 4) Crunchbase in-house data science team provide manual data validation and curation of collected data and develops algorithms (Ferrati &amp; Muffatto, 2020; &#39;The Crunchbase Data Difference&#39;, 2017).

The &quot;aggregate statistics on VC funding by country and year tend to be reasonably similar to the same figures produced with an alternative and more established source&quot;. Compared to other alternatives, the Crunchbase database &quot;does not require a huge amount of data handling before it can be used for econometric analysis&quot; (_Using Crunchbase for Economic and Managerial Research_, 2017).

As of May 21, 2019, the Crunchbase corpus contained a total of 760,590 records in the Organisation&#39;s dataset and 263,426 records in the Funding rounds dataset. Of the total number of companies approximately 79.9% do not declare any funding round, 5.5% have at least one funding round without funding amount specified and 14.6% have at least one funding round and are declaring the total funding amount (Ferrati &amp; Muffatto, 2020). The platform allows users to filter companies and funding rounds by industries. A brief database query was resolved with ~ 4,377 funding rounds for companies classified in the EdTech industry, while 3,261 of them have defined funding amounts.

# Global Learning Landscape taxonomy

The education sector is a complex system of complex systems &quot;combining important social, economic, cultural, intellectual and personal factors and operating at global, national, local and personal levels. However, information and data about education and the innovation that is occurring throughout the system is fragmented and anchored in its local environment, making cooperation across contexts difficult, thus hindering material innovation in the sector&quot;.

To bring clarity and navigate in the fast-changing environment of the sector we utilize the [2021 Global Learning Landscape](https://github.com/HolonIQ/learning-landscape/tree/02fc72c67781fe72ea788f36beaa2c1743db902c), an open-source, taxonomy for education innovation li-censed under Creative Commons ([CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)). The taxonomy provides &quot;a common structure and language for identifying, tracking and making sense of the volume and complexity of innovation happening in education globally. The taxonomy provides a well-defined, robust, accessible and community enabled segmentation&quot;. A total of 55 clusters are defined by a combination of bottom-up approach analysis by HolonIQ&#39;s Global Intelligence Platform, leveraging AI&amp;ML unsupervised algorithms on 60,000+ education organizations worldwide, which augments top-down analysis by HolonIQ&#39;s global network of experts (HolonIQ, 2021b). Clusters such as Tutoring, Apps, Admissions Platforms, Finance, and more, are contained in the taxonomy. Each cluster is accompanied by description. The HolonIQ also runs [a website](https://www.globallearninglandscape.org/) presenting overall statistics and example samples of companies in each cluster, however without more detailed presentation of each company (see HolonIQ, 2021a).

# Methodology

Representation of companies in the Global learning landscape taxonomy is presented in the form of frequency analysis.

## Research sample

A sample of 5 companies was selected for further analysis from a list of companies. The 5 companies with the biggest funding amount sum for each continent excluding South America were selected. The list was build based on funding rounds entries from the funding rounds dataset. The funding rounds dataset was obtained from the Crunchbase database and contained 3229 funding rounds of companies classified by the Crunchbase as EdTech companies.

## Obtaining the dataset

The dataset of funding rounds for further analysis was obtained using an export feature from the Crunchbase database which returns a .csv file corresponding to a selected query. Since the database proclaims an export limit of 500 items (rows) per request, we obtained the dataset in chucks to prevent hitting the limit and then constructed the dataset by concatenating the .csv files.

The queries were composed and posted through the Crunchbase Pro web application Funding Rounds query builder. The queries were run consecutively on April 21, 2021. The platform&#39;s team or its users may submit new data into the database (including historical data) or edit existing entries. Therefore, no guarantee running the same query at different time will respond with the same results.

The queries requested fields list:

&quot;funded\_organization\_identifier&quot;, &quot;investment\_type&quot;, &quot;money\_raised&quot;, &quot;announced\_on&quot;, &quot;funded\_organization\_description&quot;, &quot;funded\_organization\_categories&quot;, &quot;funded\_organization\_location&quot;, &quot;funded\_organization\_website&quot;, &quot;funded\_organization\_funding\_stage&quot;.

The query&#39;s predicates:

&#39;Organization Industries&#39; includes any &#39;EdTech&#39;,<br />
field:&quot;funded\_organization\_categories&quot;<br />
operator: includes,<br />
value: EdTech.

&#39;Money Raised&#39; is set (not blank):<br />
field: money\_raised,<br />
operator: blank,<br />
value: false.

&#39;Announced Date&#39; is between provided date tuple:<br />
field: announced\_on,<br />
operator: between,<br />
values: date tuple.

The queries were run for following date tuples:

- 1-1-2009,9-30-2014,
- 9-31-2014,9-15-2017,
- 9-16-2017,3-8-2020,
- 3-9-2020,4-21-2021.

As the query shows, we have obtained companies categorized in the EdTech industry. Note, that Crunchbase distinguishes different industries related to education. Companies classified in those may or may not be part of the EdTech cluster

The dataset was a CSV collection of raw, denormalized records of funding rounds corresponding to the query. The entries contained more granular fields of requested query fields corresponding to the API documentation e.g. &#39;money\_raised&#39; field was resolved with 3 fields that are: &#39;money\_raised&#39;, &#39;money\_raised\_currency\_code&#39;, &#39;money\_raised\_usd&#39;.

## Data processing

The data processing was done in a popular data science online notebook platform and the source code has been [published online](https://deepnote.com/@cernockyd/Exploring-Crunchbase-EdTech-funding-rounds-data-r_Bp4q9dTZiA5DSPDtHOEg). We used Python3 and popular data science SciPy libraries for data processing, namely:

- NumPy: &quot;the fundamental package for numerical computation. It defines the numerical array and matrix types and basic operations on them&quot;,
- Pandas: &quot;providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures&quot;,
- Matplotlib: &quot;a mature and popular plotting package that provides publication-quality 2-D plotting, as well as rudimentary 3-D plotting&quot; (_Scientific Computing Tools for Python_, n.d.).

The funding rounds records were manipulated using the Pandas library, which includes methods for filtration and procedures. We&#39;ve applied standard operations on them to parse date entries, numerical values, location and industry classification data.

The funding round entry&#39;s funding amount could be initially submitted in any currency. We used a funding amount provided in USD to ensure the compatibility of funding amounts for comparisons. That means a conversion from the original funding amount to USD on the Crunchbase side may happen if necessary. The Crunchbase data API documentation claims the currency conversion is done based on the date of the funding round announcement.

The previously mentioned documentation and a brief Google search query: &#39;site:crunchbase.com funding amount inflation adjusted&#39; suggested that funding amounts most likely were not adjusted for inflation. A $1 in January 2010 has the same buying power as ~ $1.24 in May 2021. To make the funding amounts comparable, we performed an inflation adjustment correction on each record, for May 2021. A list of individual companies was build based on the funding rounds data. For company comparison based on the total funding amount, a sum of the total funding amount for each company was aggregated using inflation-adjusted funding amount (USD).

### Inflation adjustment detail

The monthly consumer prices inflation in the United States were used for inflation adjustment. Inflation reflects the percentage change over time in the cost of acquiring a basket of goods and services for the average consumer. The inflation may be fixed or changed at specified intervals based on the use case (The World Bank Group, 2021). &quot;The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services&quot; (Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, 2017). The CPI for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), monthly U.S. city average with the base period 1982-84=100 was selected to compute the inflation rate for the adjustment. Many indexes could be used to determine the inflation rate but they should be approximately similar for this thesis. The CPI-U index is commonly reported by the national media (Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, 2019). According to the Czech Statistical Office, (2021), the monthly CPI is frequently used. The monthly periodicity also appears to be the most granular option available in the U.S. Department of Labor Data Retrieval Tool.

# Results summary

The analysis has shown that selected companies focus on problems and correspond to trends that are in some cases similar to those stated by industry experts. Among the selected companies, we most often identify inclusion in the Education Management (20 companies), Apps (19 companies) and Curriculum (14 companies) clusters. Those clusters are also the most general ones in the sense they do not discriminate products speaking of problems they are aiming to solve. Classification to those clusters has shown that leveraging machine learning and data science algorithms, using apps and arranging products around curriculum are de-facto standards among selected companies.

Based on the other clusters, we consider After School (10 companies), and Upskilling (8 companies) are aiming to solve the most distinguishable problems: Quality Education, Test Preparation and School Help, and the Future of Working and Skills.

**After school:** the analysis confirms HolonIQ&#39;s (2021b) statement, that After School is &quot;arguably the fastest growing segment in the Asian EdTech space, online and offline after school tutoring and coaching supports millions of students every day of the week in thousands of online and offline classrooms and clinics&quot;. Analysed companies in this cluster often occur also in Tutoring, Pre-K and Language Learning clusters. After School companies from Asia are also represented in the Pre-K cluster developing highly scalable gamified products for children and eg. in the Q&amp;A cluster which is supplementary. Apart from other companies, 17zuoye is also present in the Prop Online and Teacher Resources clusters developing products for schools and surrounding the education lower education ecosystem. Asian companies are specific in the Tutoring cluster, since they focus mainly on large-class delivery, unlike others that focus on 1-on-1 lessons.

**Upskilling:** 10 analysed companies tackle with the future of work and skills &quot;workers in the twenty first century will likely have many jobs and multiple careers through their adult lives, they will need to constantly update knowledge and skills to remain relevant and able to fulfil ever changing job requirements&quot; (HolonIQ, 2021b). Companies in the Upskilling cluster focus on providing highly practical educational services to individuals as well as corporate customers. Some leverage the position and build their product around the Gigs ecosystem matching the workers with skills and jobs.

Among other notable trends, we observe more traditional companies adapting to the new situation seeking a position in the rapidly scalable world, see Gems Education, SEQTA; Crimson Education and Laureate Education.

# Conclusion and discussion

There is no doubt that the education sector is undergoing unprecedented changes and faces new challenges. With quickly changing learning contexts, learning needs and the growth of technology, the whole landscape of education changes affecting every dimension from tea-ching facilitation delivery to core curriculums. We found that among companies located in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America and Oceania which received the biggest funding amounts, Education Management solutions that make learning data visible to teachers, students, employers or parents are actually standard as well as providing users with Apps. Focus on After School services, and Upskilling are most significant in terms of numbers of companies competing in the clusters.

In order to draw detailed comparisons among companies, a more in-depth analysis of each company is needed. It could be built on our existing findings and datasets. Our potential next step for the study is leveraging existing auxiliary analysis beyond using it as a support process to identify Global Learning Taxonomy clusters and gain more insight. Approximation of possible &#39;end game scenarios&#39; for the companies by linking the companies reported user bases, financial statements, product pricing with the industry experts market size approximations is an ultimate goal.
