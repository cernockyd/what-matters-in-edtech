# Introduction

It is common knowledge that education needs to adapt to the fast-changing world. In particular, when thinking about preparing the youth for the future, it is clear that the growing worldwide ICT usage and development raises new requirements for education and new opportunities in terms of effectiveness, quality, and scalability.

The education system is a complex system of complex systems with corresponding difficulties, namely when it comes to driving change.

Technology use in education promises to empower the educational system to serve the growth of its complexity while reducing the subjective complexity for all participants.

Over the past years, nothing has changed in edtech. (Unknown) However, everything has changed, which is true, especially if we look at the unprecedented events of 2020, which made the classic form of education impossible in a very short time for up to about 1.5 billion students at the peak (Unesco, 2020). The events have drawn attention to companies and startups developing relevant products and, due to their suddenness, initiated education disruption (Mascarenhas, 2020). 

Both market and the academic world have in common the pursuit of prediction of the future. This thesis holds a narrow perspective on what matters in EdTech and aims to examine some of the trends without mentioning economics and politics to a proper degree. Instead of naively describing the trends, we strive to interpret them from within the field to provide a slightly uncommon-sense perspective.

# What is EdTech

Educational technology is a fairly established term both in the general audience and within the education profession. (Huang et al., 2019) It is also a very vague term. Educational technology (commonly abbreviated as EdTech) is usually “understood as the utilisation of apps and tech devices for the purpose of teaching and learning. EdTech can happen inside or outside of classrooms, at any time and in any place. Most modern EdTech typically involves the use of a wireless internet connection and an electronic device such as a smartphone, tablet, laptop or desktop computer." (European Commission. Joint Research Centre., 2021) To prevent misunderstanding and some of the most naive interpretations of the field, defining EdTech and clarifying the aims and scopes of the discipline is crucial. “Various professional and scholarly communities have provided a specific definition of the term.” (Huang et al., 2019) However, similarly to other areas, the definition is not straightforward, and there is no clear definition of the term educational technology. (‘Reflections on the 2008 AECT Definitions of the Field’, 2008) According to Weller (2018), an evident theme in the field is that there appear to be no shared concepts or history. He attributes it to the fact that many people from various backgrounds and disciplines enter the field. Another factor is the changing circumstances. As the technological and educational practice evolves, the community reflects shortcomings of existing definitions and come up with new ones. (‘Reflections on the 2008 AECT Definitions of the Field’, 2008)

The study of Bozkurt (2020) on research patterns in EdTech suggests there are diverse, recurring attitudes towards EdTech. While the research trends, as expected, vary, two general critical stances are present, which we consider being the ones that draw an important distinction in the understanding of EdTech: a) Technology positivists determinism, 2) Technology integration attitude characterised by the view, in which learning is considered to be more of a social process. The attitudes are, to some extent, contrary to each other. However, we think they complement each other since the latter is anchored in relational thought, which acknowledges the former - technology determinism and sees it as a point of concern. (An and Oliver, 2021)

“The word ‘education’ comes to us from Latin educare, which means upbringing, training, or support based on the combination of ex or more simply e (from, or out of) and ducere (to lead, to guide). The derivation of the modern term is informative as it suggests that education involves a purpose or a goal, and a process of support or guidance toward the achievement of that goal.” (Spector, 2016)

Education — systematic efforts to develop (a) basic and specialized knowledge and skills, (b) problem-solving abilities, (c) productive workers, (d) higher-order reasoning capabilities, (d) responsible citizens, and/or (f) lifelong learners (Spector, 2015)

## Human-technology

“‘Technology’ is one of the keywords of our world, yet it is also one of the most confused.” (Agar, 2020) The term is being used also to represent processes, actions, methods and systems and in a symbolical meaning as an attribute with notion of evaluation. According to Kline (2985) the most common usage of the term denotes to artifacts or, if you want, a hardware manufactured by human. However, such denotation does not correspond to its original meaning.

The origin of the word technology can be found in the ancient Greek word ‘technología’ joined of two words ’techné’, which stands for art, craft, or skill, the suffix ‘-logía‘ can be translated as understanding of something, or as a branch of knowledge. (Spector, 2016; Oliver, 2016; Selwyn, 2017)

The second most common usage of the term, according to Kline (1985), is to represent a ‘sociotechnical system of manufacture’ which comprehends all the elements needed to manufacture a particular kind of hardware. The third common usage refers to the information, skills, processes, and procedures for accomplishing tasks. The fourth meaning of technology, which is commonly present in public discussion, called by Kline a ‘sociotechnical systems of use’ encompasses “system using combinations of hardware, people (and usually other elements) to accomplish tasks that humans cannot perform unaided by such systems”. As an example of such system, Kline mentions a system of transport. Notice that such of a description of a system could also in some degree correspond to the educational system, although Klein didn't mentioned educational system at all in the work.

Especially in the field of education, ”our primary focus should not be on the actual technological devices, tools and applications per se, but the practices and activities that surround them, the meanings that people attach to them, and the social relations and structures that these technologies are linked to.” (Selwyn, 2017)
